# ALR

ALR is a game-based resolution changer that allows for a small footprint and simple design that allows for easy usage.

### History
ALR started as a Command-line Interface python script which was exclusively made for Apex Legends hence the ALR since it did stand for Apex Legends Resolution but it didn't make sense but the name stuck so I kept it while I was making it more and more complex.

The position that it is now is most likely it's final form apart from any bug fixes, from CLI -> UI with adjustable values -> UI with process monitoring and custom resolution settings.

### Detection
The likelihood of being banned with this software is VERY low, since this application doesn't read or write any memory of any games, but reads from the current processes. Sorta like process explorer or task manager.

If you are banned while using this application, please raise it in the issues section since I will look into what caused it.

I have been using this application while playing CS 2 and Apex Legends and other live service games and I haven't seen any issues yet.

### Pre-compiled Binaries
There are pre-compiled binaries in the releases section but if you want to build it yourself then all the files that are needed are within ALR_build folder.

I also forgot which packages I am using that are custom. Giga brain.
